# AI Generated Strategy Documentation

This Python script generates a business strategy using AI-powered tools and presents it in HTML format. The strategy is tailored to address specific business challenges, with a focus on cutting-edge technologies, AI, machine learning, and data science. The generated strategy aims to ensure growth and efficiency for the company, as exemplified by the use case of "Fusemachines" in the provided script.

## Script Overview
The script consists of the following main components:

1. **Function to Generate Business Strategy**: This function utilizes the Gemini API from Google's Generative AI platform to generate a business strategy based on user-defined inputs such as the company name, industry, and business challenge.

2. **Function to Generate HTML Report**: This function formats the generated strategy into HTML markup for easy visualization and presentation. It includes styling for better readability and presentation.

## Usage

To use this script:

1. Ensure you have access to the Google Generative AI platform and have obtained an API key.
2. Import the required libraries: `IPython.display`, `google.generativeai`, and `google.colab.userdata`.
3. Define the `generate_business_strategy()` function with appropriate inputs for the company name, industry, and business challenge.
4. Define the `generate_html_report()` function to format the generated strategy into HTML format.
5. Call the `generate_business_strategy()` function to generate the strategy.
6. Call the `generate_html_report()` function to generate the HTML report.
7. Display the HTML report using the `display()` function from `IPython.display`.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the script:

```python
# Generate business strategy based on user input
strategy, challenge, company_name = generate_business_strategy()

# Generate HTML report
html_report = generate_html_report(strategy, challenge, company_name)

# Display HTML report
display(HTML(html_report))
```

## Note
- Ensure that you replace the placeholder text and user inputs with actual company information and business challenges to generate relevant strategies.
- It's recommended to run this script in an environment that supports Python, such as Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- The script utilizes Gemini API, so make sure you have proper access and authorization to use them. https://ai.google.dev/
